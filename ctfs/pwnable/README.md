# pwnable.kr Walkthroughs #

## Introduction ##

These walkthroughs describe how to get through CTF challenges on pwnable.kr using the `pwntools` toolkit. They describe my thought process and methodology as I both learn these tools and figure out how to apply them to the problems at hand.

Get `pwntools`:

I run `pwntools` in a 64-bit Kali Linux virtual machine. The walkthrough is based on my experiences in that setup.

Any special setup steps I add to the process will be documented here. If they are specific to the solution to a challenge, they will be documented there.

These walkthroughs were produced by Bradley Evans, a student at the University of California-Riverside (MS, Computer Engineering). They are published for and maintained by Cybersecurity at the University of California, Riverside.
